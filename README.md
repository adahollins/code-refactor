# code-refactor

## Description

This project was improved for more accessibility. However, I also made the structure of the CSS stylesheet more chronological as well as fixing the links. The code has been improved to make it more accessible by adding alt text and using an HTML semantic field. I learned that making a clearer structure helps a lot in knowing where each part of the website is, making it easier to make changes and understand the basics of what a website needs.

## Usage

This was made it be used by the company Horiseon as their homepage. It includes information on what is needed to manage their business online and how they could help, advertising their work for others to use. 

Each article can be navigated by using the header.

The article has points on what they help with and the definitions of each so the customer can understand it better. The article on the side has the pros of working with them.
